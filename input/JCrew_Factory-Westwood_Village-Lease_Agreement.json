Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, if (a) Tenant has obtained the Permits and (b) the Possession Date has not occurred on or before the Estimated Delivery Date (as may be extended), Tenant shall receive a credit against the first accruing Rent due under the Lease in the amount of one day of Rent (determined on a per diem basis) for each day thereafter that the Possession Date has not occurred (\u201cLate Delivery Credit\u201d); provided, however, that the Late Delivery Credit shall not exceed 180 days of Rent.

If such audit shall disclose an understatement of Gross Sales as reported by Tenant to the extent of three percent (3%) or more, then Tenant shall promptly pay to Landlord the cost of said audit in addition to the Percentage Rent deficiency, if any, which deficiency shall be payable in any event. The provisions of this Section shall survive the Expiration Date. Landlord may not audit Tenant\u2019s Record for any Lease Year more than once. Landlord must submit its request to audit Tenant\u2019s Records within three (3) years following the end of the Lease Year in question, failing which, Landlord shall be deemed to have waived its right to audit Tenant\u2019s Records for such Lease Year.

In the event that during the first five (5) Lease Years, either Tenant, or any person or entity controlled by Tenant, any person or entity controlling Tenant (directly or indirectly), owns or operates any other store under the Trade Name then being used in the Premises within the Radius Area, then, as Landlord\u2019s sole and exclusive remedies, the Gross Sales of any such competing store(s) shall be included in the Gross Sales made from the Premises to determine the Percentage Rent due under this Lease, as fully as though such other location\u2019s Gross Sales had actually been made from the Premises (and all of the provisions of this Article 4 applicable to Gross Sales shall be applicable to the Gross Sales of, and all of the books and records pertaining to, such competing store(s)), and Tenant\u2019s right to terminate based on Gross Sales as set forth in Section 21.24 below shall be rendered null and void and of no further force or effect. The foregoing restriction shall not apply to any of Tenant\u2019s stores existing as of the date of this Lease. Tenant hereby acknowledges that it has no such stores open within the Radius Area as of the date of this Lease. 22 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

(e) Landlord shall have three hundred sixty five (365) days from the end of any Fiscal Year to deliver to Tenant the Fiscal Year-end Real Estate Tax Reconciliation Statement, Operating Costs Reconciliation Statement and/or Insurance Charge Reconciliation Statement for such Fiscal Year.

Tenant\u2019s Construction, Installations and Alterations. (a) All work or equipment, other than Landlord\u2019s Work, if any, shall be performed by Tenant at its own cost and expense and Tenant shall, without limitation, fully equip the Premises with all trade equipment, furniture, operating equipment, furnishings, fixtures and exterior signs and any other equipment necessary for the proper operation of Tenant\u2019s business. Whenever Tenant is performing work within the Premises, Tenant shall commence such work as soon as is practical and shall diligently prosecute such work to its completion as soon as is practical after its commencement. All fixtures installed by Tenant shall be new or completely reconditioned. Tenant shall not do any construction work or alterations, nor shall Tenant install any equipment other than trade fixtures without first obtaining Landlord\u2019s written approval and consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Tenant shall present to Landlord plans and specifications for such work at the time approval is sought in accordance with Exhibit B.

(b) Tenant may not perform any structural alterations to the Premises and/or any other repairs, renovations, remodeling or alterations to the Premises without having first received Landlord\u2019s written consent thereto. Tenant shall, before performing any major repairs, renovations, remodeling or alterations to the Premises, submit complete architectural and engineering plans and specifications of the Premises, prepared by reputable and licensed architects and engineers, describing all of the major repairs, renovations, remodeling or alterations which Tenant proposes. Upon approval by Landlord of Tenant\u2019s final plans and specifications therefor, only a reputable and licensed contractor and sub-contractors may be engaged by Tenant to perform the repairs, renovations, remodeling or alterations in accordance with the said approved plans and specifications and in accordance with the other terms and provisions of this Lease. Landlord reserves the right to require Tenant to use Landlord-required contractors for work pertaining to or impacting the roof, sprinkler system and other life safety systems (including fire and alarm panels), and building-wide systems, provided the rates charged by such contractors are reasonable and competitive within the geographic area of the Shopping Center. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may, without the prior written consent of Landlord, make non-structural, cosmetic alterations to the interior of the Premises, such as painting of the interior walls of the Premises or installing new flooring within the Premises, that do not, in the aggregate, exceed One Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($150,000.00) in any Lease Year, so long as such cosmetic alterations do not affect any of the utility or other systems servicing the Premises or other premises within the Shopping Center and do not include the construction of any additional demising or other walls within the Premises. In the event Landlord fails to timely respond to Tenant\u2019s plans and specifications within twenty (20) days after Landlord\u2019s receipt of such plans, then if such failure continues for more than five (5) business days after Tenant\u2019s subsequent delivery of a \u201cDeadline Letter\u201d (as hereinafter defined), Tenant\u2019s plans submitted to Landlord shall be deemed approved. For purposes hereof, the term \u201cDeadline Letter\u201d shall be defined as a letter which states in bold letters the following: \u201cLandlord is obligated to respond to the attached plans and specifications within five (5) business days after receipt. If Landlord fails to respond to this Deadline Letter within such five (5) business day period, then the plans shall be deemed approved by Landlord\u201d. For avoidance of doubt, the Deadline Letter shall be sent to Landlord\u2019s notice address set forth in Section 1.01 of the Lease. 37 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

(d) Tenant agrees that Tenant\u2019s Work and any other alteration, modification, change or improvement to the Premises completed by Tenant in accordance with the terms of this Lease shall not be done in a manner that would create a Conflict. Tenant shall immediately stop any work or other activity if such work or activity causes a Conflict. Tenant shall indemnify, defend with legal counsel reasonably approved by Landlord or selected by Landlord and hold harmless Landlord from any loss, cost or liability suffered or incurred by Landlord as a result of Tenant\u2019s violation of the provisions of this paragraph. Tenant\u2019s violation of the terms hereof beyond the applicable notice and cure period shall constitute a default hereunder and shall entitle Landlord to exercise any remedies that are available to Landlord at law, in equity or hereunder, including, without limitation, seeking an injunction.

For avoidance of doubt, however, Tenant shall be entitled to one (1) storefront sign of the maximum size permitted by Law on each of three of the Premises\u2019 facades (in recognition that the Premises is an end-cap space) and Landlord\u2019s signage criteria on the designated sign band of the Premises. Tenant shall maintain any such sign or other installation as may be approved in good condition and repair. All signs, awnings and canopies shall comply with all applicable Laws and the applicable terms set forth in the Construction Criteria, shall be consistent with the general design of the Shopping Center, shall be in appropriate proportion to the size of Tenant\u2019s storefront. Subject to Tenant\u2019s compliance with Law and the signage criteria, Tenant shall have the right to place up any signage within the interior of the Premises provided same is professionally prepared and consistent with Tenant\u2019s other locations. (b) In the event Landlord, in its sole discretion, shall elect to renovate and/or remodel all or part of the Shopping Center, in order to facilitate any such renovations and/or remodeling (including Tenant\u2019s fa\u00e7ade) Tenant, upon request by Landlord and at Landlord\u2019s sole cost and expense, shall remove any and all of Tenant\u2019s exterior signs and replace its exterior signs with a new sign or signs in conformity with the uniform signage criteria of the new fa\u00e7ade.

Tenant shall, at Tenant\u2019s expense, perform all work and supply all installations necessary to install Tenant\u2019s identification panel in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by Landlord. No changes to Tenant\u2019s identification panel plans and specifications will be made without the prior written consent of Landlord, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Tenant agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to promptly repair Tenant\u2019s identification panel in the event of any casualty or other damage thereto. Tenant further agrees to repair any damage to the Pylon Sign resulting from Tenant\u2019s installation or removal of Tenant\u2019s identification panel. In the event Tenant fails to remove Tenant\u2019s identification panel within ten (10) days after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Landlord shall have the right to remove and dispose of Tenant\u2019s identification panel at Tenant\u2019s sole cost and expense, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for all actual, third-party costs incurred by Landlord in removing and disposing of Tenant\u2019s identification panel, plus a sum equal to ten percent (10%) of such cost to reimburse Landlord for its administrative overhead. If Tenant fails to repair any damage caused by the installation or removal of Tenant\u2019s identification panel, and such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after written notice from Landlord, then Landlord shall have the right to perform same on Tenant\u2019s behalf, and Tenant shall pay the actual, reasonable, third-party cost thereof to Landlord within fifteen (15) days of Landlord\u2019s written demand, together with the sum of ten percent (10%) of said costs for overhead. Tenant\u2019s obligations set forth in this Subsection shall survive the termination of this Lease. Tenant further agrees that in no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for failure or interruption of any illumination of the Pylon Sign or Tenant\u2019s identification panel, or for any damage to Tenant\u2019s identification panel, and Tenant hereby waives any and all such claims against Landlord. The foregoing right of Tenant to place Tenant\u2019s identification panel on the Pylon Sign is personal to, and for the sole benefit of Tenant, and shall not be transferable to any third party, including without limitation to any assignee of Tenant\u2019s rights under this Lease or any sublessee of all or a portion of the Premises, without the express prior written consent of Landlord, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole discretion. Tenant agrees that any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be null and void. Tenant\u2019s rights under this provision shall be subject and subordinate to the requirements of all applicable Laws, including any modifications to the Pylon Sign required by the foregoing. Therefore, in the event any modifications to the Pylon Sign required by Law require that Tenant\u2019s sign be removed from the Pylon Sign, then Landlord may terminate Tenant\u2019s rights to have signage on the Pylon Sign, provided Landlord is simultaneously terminating the right to place signage on the Pylon Sign of all other tenants with signage on the Pylon Sign, and in the event of such termination, Tenant shall remove Tenant\u2019s identification panel and repair any damage caused by such removal in accordance with the terms of 39 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

If Tenant fails to cause such lien or notice of lien to be discharged within such period, then Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, discharge the same either by paying the amounts claimed to be due or by procuring the discharge of such lien by deposit, bond or otherwise, and Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days following its receipt of written demand, reimburse Landlord for any and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Landlord to discharge such lien including, without limitation, all reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, court costs and similar expenses, plus an administrative fee equal ten percent (10%) of such costs and expenses incurred by Landlord.

(a) Landlord shall have the right to place, maintain and repair all utility equipment of any kind in, upon, around and under the Premises as may be necessary for the service of the Premises and other portions of Landlord\u2019s property and Landlord (for itself and other tenants in the Shopping Center) hereby reserves the right to install, maintain, use, repair and replace pipes, ducts, conduits, wires, utilities and structural elements leading through, under and over the Premises in locations which will not unreasonably interfere with Tenant\u2019s use thereof so long as same are installed below the finished floor, within or along a wall or column, or above or along the finished ceiling. Landlord shall also have the right to enter the Premises at all reasonable times, on reasonable advanced written notice, but not less than 24 hours (other than in the event of an emergency), to inspect or to exhibit the same to prospective purchasers, mortgagees, ground lessors and tenants, and to make such repairs, additions, alterations or improvements as Landlord may deem necessary, provided in no event shall Landlord be permitted to reduce the square footage of the Premises or otherwise reconfigure the Premises.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Landlord\u2019s exercise of its rights under this Article 9 materially adversely interferes with Tenant\u2019s operation from the Premises to the extent that Tenant is reasonably unable to operate its business in the Premises for more than forty eight (48) hours following written notice to Landlord of such interference, which notice shall set forth with particularity the exact nature of Landlord's interference, and Tenant has actually closed for business as a result of same, then all Rent due under this Lease shall be abated from and after the end of such 48 hour period and continuing until the date the interference cited in Tenant\u2019s notice ceases. ARTICLE 10: UTILITIES Section 10.01. Utilities. (a) Except for water and trash removal, which shall be included in Tenant\u2019s Share of Operating Costs, Tenant shall be solely responsible for contracting directly with all utility providers and promptly paying all charges for utilities (including meter and sub-meter fees, impact fees and tap fees associated with Tenant\u2019s occupancy), including, without limitation, heat, electricity, sewers and/or any other utility used or consumed in or for the Premises commencing from the Possession Date; provided, however, if any utility is sub-metered, then Tenant shall pay the applicable utility charge directly to Landlord based upon the actual meter reading of the submeter. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord any charges incurred by Landlord for meter or sub-meter readings, and Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall be responsible for having all utilities transferred into Tenant\u2019s name as of the Possession Date. If Landlord elects to supply or to designate a supplier of the water, gas, heat, electricity, trash removal or any other utility used or consumed in the Premises, then Tenant agrees to purchase and pay for the same as Additional Rent at the then applicable rates charged by local suppliers to similar users but in no event shall Tenant pay more than it would had it contracted directly with the applicable utility provider, and, Landlord shall, at its cost, install a submeter to measure such utility consumption. Where Landlord provides a service to a limited number of users, Landlord shall have the right to reasonably determine the charge to such users based on the square footage (provided that reasonable allocations shall be made for uses that are not reasonably similar in utility demand, such as a restaurant demand for water) of each such tenant or based on usage estimates, provided any such allocation shall be done in good faith and Tenant shall have the right to challenge, in good faith, any such determination. (b) As of the Effective Date, the Shopping Center and the Premises are receiving electric service from one or more suppliers. Landlord shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, during the Lease Term to either contract for service from a different company or companies providing electricity service or continue to contract for service from the electric service provider(s) existing as of the Effective Date, provided there shall be no interruption of service to the Premises. (c) Tenant shall reasonably cooperate (at no cost to Tenant) with Landlord, the existing electric service provider(s), and any alternate service provider selected by Landlord, at all times and shall allow Landlord and any such electric service provider, to access the electric lines, feeders, risers, wiring, and any other equipment or machinery within the Premises, subject in all respects to the terms of this Lease regarding any entry into the Premises or any work performed in the Premises.

ARTICLE 11: ASSIGNMENT; SUBLEASE Section 11.01. Assignment or Subletting. (a) Except as expressly provided in Section 11.01(h) below, and notwithstanding any references to assignees, subtenants, concessionaires or other similar entities in this Lease, Tenant shall not (i) without Landlord\u2019s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed: (a) assign this Lease, (b) sublet the Premises or any part thereof, or permit the use of the Premises or any part thereof by any persons other than Tenant or its agents or (c) permit the assignment or other transfer of this Lease, or any of Tenant\u2019s rights hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise; nor (ii) without Landlord\u2019s prior written consent, which consent shall be in Landlord\u2019s sole discretion, mortgage or encumber this Lease or any of its rights hereunder. Any such attempted or purported transfer, assignment, mortgaging or encumbering of this Lease or any of Tenant\u2019s interest therein and any attempted or purported subletting or grant of a right to use or occupy all or a portion of the Premises in violation of the foregoing, whether voluntary or involuntary, or by operation of law or otherwise, in addition to being a default under this Lease (subject to applicable notice and cure periods), shall be null and void and shall not confer any rights upon any purported transferee, assignee, mortgagee or occupant. Tenant acknowledges that the factors governing the granting of Landlord\u2019s consent to any transfer may include, without limitation, (i) the restrictive clauses entered into with other tenants by Landlord (but no such restrictions entered into after the Effective Date shall be applicable to the extent they would act as a restriction on the use of the Premises for the Permitted Use), (ii) the financial background, business history and the capability of the proposed transferee considering the financial responsibility involved, and (iii) the nature of the business practices of the proposed transferee. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 11.01(a) above, Tenant shall have the right to grant concessions, licenses or subleases for the sale of merchandise within or from the Premises as part of the normal business of Tenant provided not more than twenty five percent of the Premises shall be subject to such concessions, licenses or subleases at any time. (c) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Lease, the consent by Landlord to any assignment, transfer or subletting to any party shall not be construed as a waiver or release of Tenant under the terms of any covenant or obligation under this Lease or as a waiver or release of the non- assignability covenants in their future application, nor shall the collection or acceptance of Rent payments from any such assignee, transferee, subtenant or occupant constitute a waiver or release of Tenant from any covenant or obligation contained in this Lease. If this Lease is transferred or assigned, as aforesaid, or if the Premises, or any part thereof, be sublet or occupied by any person or entity other than Tenant, whether as a result of any act or omission by Tenant, or by operation of law, or otherwise, then Landlord may in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies under this Lease or pursuant to law to which Landlord may be entitled as a result thereof, collect 44 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

(d) Without conferring any rights upon Tenant not otherwise provided in this Article, if Tenant desires to enter into any assignment, sublease or transfer of this Lease or Tenant \u2018s rights hereunder, Tenant shall request in writing Landlord\u2019s consent thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed as provided above). Without limiting any other reasonable basis for withholding consent, it shall not be unreasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent if: (i) an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d (as hereinafter defined) exists; (ii) the use of the Premises would not comply with the provisions of this Lease; or (iii) in Landlord\u2019s reasonable judgment, the proposed transferee does not have the financial capability to perform its obligations under this Lease with respect to the Premises which are the subject of the assignment or sublease. At least sixty (60) days before the proposed effective date of any such proposed transfer, Tenant shall submit to Landlord the following: (i) the material particulars of the proposed assignment, sublease or transfer, including its nature, effective date, material terms and conditions and copies of any letters of intent; and (ii) a description of the identity, tangible net worth and previous business experience of the proposed assignee, subtenant or transferee including, without limitation, copies of the proposed assignee\u2019s, subtenant\u2019s or transferee\u2019s latest income, balance sheet and changes in financial position statements (with accompanying notes and disclosures of all material changes thereto) in audited form, if available, and certified as accurate by the proposed assignee, subtenant or transferee; and (iii) any further information and documentation relevant to the proposed assignment, sublease or transfer which Landlord shall request after receipt of Tenant\u2019s request for consent including, without limitation, a written assumption agreement from the assignee or transferee. Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Assignment Administrative Fee and shall reimburse Landlord for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees) incurred in connection with processing any proposed assignment or sublease, not to exceed in the aggregate, $5,000.00. The Assignment Administrative Fee shall be payable by Tenant to Landlord together with Tenant\u2019s written request for Landlord\u2019s consent to the assignment, transfer or sublease and shall be non-refundable, whether or not Landlord grants or denies its consent. If such payment does not accompany Tenant\u2019s request, then Landlord shall have the right to treat the request as null and void and improperly delivered until such time as the payment is received. Landlord shall, within thirty (30) business days after receiving the information required herein (and the Assignment Administrative Fee) notify Tenant of its approval or disapproval of the proposed sublease or assignment, with a reasonably detailed explanation for any disapproval.

(g) In the event this Lease is assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part, with or without Landlord\u2019s consent or approval, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a fully executed copy of the assignment and assumption of lease, sublease or other transfer document, along with the transferee\u2019s then current contact information, a written affirmation of Guarantor approving the transfer and acknowledging that the Guaranty remains effective, and Tenant shall at all times remain primarily liable for the full performance of all of the terms, covenants and conditions contained in this Lease and for all obligations accrued or accruing under this Lease.

In no event shall Tenant be permitted to use a series of one or more Permitted Transfers to \"spin-off\" this Lease to independent third parties. As an example of the foregoing, Tenant shall not assign this Lease to an affiliate corporation whose assets consist solely of this Lease and the rights granted herein and thereafter sell the stock of such affiliate corporation to an independent third party. The result of what would otherwise be two, independent Permitted Transfers would become a transfer of this Lease to an independent third party. Any such transfer is prohibited by the terms of Section 11.01(a). above. In the event of a Permitted Transfer, the following shall apply: (i) in case of an assignment, Tenant shall cause the assignee to expressly assume in writing and agree to perform all of the covenants, duties and obligations of Tenant hereunder and such assignee shall be jointly and severally liable therefor along with Tenant; (ii) A signed counterpart of all such instruments relative thereto, executed by all parties to such transaction with the exception of Landlord shall be submitted by Tenant to Landlord within thirty (30) days of execution of same; and (iii) unless Tenant is the disappearing entity following a merger or consolidation of Tenant with any other company, Tenant shall remain directly and primarily liable for the performance of all of the covenants, duties and obligations of Tenant hereunder (including, without limitation, the obligation to pay all rent and other sums herein provided to be paid), and Landlord shall be permitted to enforce the provisions of this instrument against the undersigned Tenant and/or any assignee without demand upon or proceeding in any way against any other person; and (iv) the use and operation being conducted in the Leased Premises shall remain substantially unaffected. No such assignment shall be deemed to be binding on Landlord until such time as Landlord has received an original counterpart of the documents used to effect the assignment signed by both the assignor and the assignee, provided, however that such assignment shall be effective as of the date such original documents were fully executed so long as Landlord receives a copy of such documents within thirty (30) days after their effective date. 46 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

(ii) All companies providing Tenant\u2019s insurance shall have and maintain a minimum AM Best rating of A-VIII. Tenant may not self-insure any part of the required liability insurance coverages (other than plate glass insurance), nor may the total of Tenant\u2019s deductibles and self-insurance retentions exceed commercially reasonable amounts. 49 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

(iv) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord certificates of insurance for all insurance required to be maintained by Tenant in the form of ACORD 28 (Evidence of Property Insurance) and ACORD 25 (Certificate of Liability Insurance) (or in a form acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion), no later than the Possession Date (but in any event prior to any entry onto the Premises by Tenant or any employee, agent or contractor of Tenant, if such entry is any earlier than the Possession Date). Upon request, Tenant shall also provide to Landlord a true, correct and complete copy of the actual insurance policy for all insurance required to be maintained by Tenant hereof. Tenant shall, prior to expiration of any required coverage, furnish Landlord with certificates of renewal or \u201cbinders\u201d thereof. Each policy shall expressly provide that such policies shall not be cancelable or otherwise subject to material modification, except after thirty (30) days\u2019 prior written notice to the parties named as Additional Insureds in this Lease (except in the case of cancellation for nonpayment of premium in which case cancellation shall not take effect until at least ten (10) days\u2019 notice has been given to Landlord). Acceptance by Landlord of delivery of any certificates of insurance does not constitute approval or agreement by Landlord that the insurance requirements in the insurance Section have been met, and failure of Landlord to demand such evidence of full compliance with these insurance requirements or failure of Landlord to identify a deficiency from evidence provided will not be construed as a waiver of Tenant\u2019s obligation to maintain such insurance. If Tenant fails to maintain any insurance required in this Lease, Tenant shall be liable for all losses and costs suffered or incurred by Landlord (including litigation costs and attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses) resulting from said failure. (b) From and after Additional Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay, as Additional Rent, to Landlord, without any deduction, abatement or setoff whatsoever, except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Lease to the contrary, an amount equal to Tenant\u2019s Share of the \u201cInsurance Charge\u201d, which is defined as any and all costs and expenses of every kind and nature as may be paid or incurred by Landlord directly, or through an operating and easement agreement or other encumbrances upon the Shopping Center, in insuring the Shopping Center buildings, Common Areas and other improvements, including without limitation, the cost and expense of providing or causing any or all of the following to be provided (but Landlord shall be required to provide no less than the coverage set forth in (i) and (ii) below): (i) Special Form Cause of Loss Policy (or an equivalent policy that becomes the insurance industry standard in the future) on the Shopping Center improvements constructed by Landlord in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the insurable value of such improvements, together with endorsements insuring against such other risks as Landlord and/or its lender(s) deem(s) appropriate (including, but not limited to, earthquake, flood, boiler and machinery, plate glass, mold, windstorm, terrorism, seepage or leakage and loss of rent) and in such amounts, with such terms and with such insurers, all as Landlord deems appropriate in Landlord\u2019s sole discretion. Such insurance shall specifically exclude Tenant\u2019s personal property and the interior leasehold improvements, mechanical equipment and permanent fixtures that Tenant is obligated to maintain and insure pursuant to the terms of this Lease; (ii) commercial general liability insurance with regard to the Common Areas with minimum limits of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence, Two Million and 00/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) general aggregate, for bodily injury, death and property damage liability. Landlord shall have the right to carry its insurance under \u201cblanket\u201d and/or \u201cumbrella\u201d policies covering the Shopping Center and other properties.

Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to maintain commercial insurance policies covering some or all of the deductibles, self-insured retentions or the like which are provided in any of Landlord\u2019s other insurance policies; (iii) such other form or forms of insurance as Landlord and/or its lender(s) reasonably consider(s) advisable including but not limited to rental income insurance; and (iv) Intentionally deleted. (c) Tenant\u2019s payment of Tenant\u2019s Share of Insurance Charge shall be paid in equal monthly installments simultaneously with the Minimum Annual Rent payable hereunder. The foregoing amount shall be adjusted annually at the end of each Fiscal Year, which adjustment shall be based upon Landlord\u2019s estimation of the then current Insurance Charge and Tenant\u2019s Share thereof. (d) Following the end of each Fiscal Year, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a statement of the prior Fiscal Year\u2019s Insurance Charge (\u201cInsurance Charge Reconciliation Statement\u201d), which shall include a statement of the total deposits Tenant made toward such Fiscal Year\u2019s Insurance Charge and the total share of the actual Insurance Charge. There shall be an appropriate adjustment made between Landlord and Tenant based thereon. If such adjustment shows a balance due to Landlord, such balance shall be payable by Tenant within thirty (30) days after delivery of the annual Insurance Charge Reconciliation Statement; if such adjustment shows a balance due to Tenant, then Tenant shall have a credit against the next payments of Minimum Annual Rent due Landlord in the amount of the balance due (or such shall be paid within thirty (30) days after its determination if after the Expiration Date), in either case after first deducting therefrom any due and outstanding Rent then owed to Landlord. The foregoing shall survive the Expiration Date. At any time throughout the Lease Term, Landlord shall have the right to recalculate Landlord\u2019s estimate of Insurance Charge due from Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, which computations shall be an estimate based upon the most recent annual statements of Insurance Charge and Tenant\u2019s Share of Insurance Charge shall be adjusted accordingly. (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, prior to calculating Insurance Charge, Landlord shall have the right to exclude from the Shopping Center, and the denominator used to calculate Tenant\u2019s Share, the square footage of any portions thereof that are: (i) owned, leased or occupied by parties that self-insure all or any portion of the Shopping Center; (ii) any Major Tenant, provided that the contributions for Insurance Charge made to Landlord by any such Major Tenant, if any, are deducted from the Insurance Charge prior to the calculation of Tenant\u2019s Share thereof; (iii) non-retail office space located within the Shopping Center and/or (iv) a kiosk, gas station, electric charging stations, rooftop facilities (cellular communications, etc.), public library, post office or other governmental agency or office, basement or mezzanine area, storage area, garden area, outdoor sales area, patios/outdoor seating area, temporary or seasonal sales area, outdoor lumber or material storage area, Shopping Center management office, and/or decommissioned space within the Shopping Center. (f) Landlord makes no representation or warranty to Tenant that the amount of insurance to be carried by Tenant under the terms of this Lease is adequate to fully protect Tenant\u2019s interest. If Tenant believes that the amount of any such insurance is insufficient, Tenant is encouraged to obtain, at its sole cost and expense, such additional insurance as Tenant may deem desirable or adequate. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord shall not, by the fact of approving, disapproving, waiving, accepting, or obtaining any insurance, incur any liability for or with respect to the amount of insurance carried, the form or legal sufficiency of such insurance, the solvency of any insurance companies or the payment or defense of any lawsuit in connection with such insurance coverage, 51 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

(g) Prior to the Possession Date or such earlier date that Tenant or its agents, employees or contractors are permitted to access the Premises, at least ten (10) days prior to the cancellation or termination of Tenant\u2019s insurance policies and within ten (10) days after Landlord\u2019s written request therefor, Tenant shall provide Landlord with certificates of insurance evidencing that Tenant has insurance coverages at least equal to the coverages required herein, that Tenant\u2019s insurance is in full force and effect and that Landlord is named as an additional insured under Tenant\u2019s liability insurance policies. Section 15.03. Increase in Insurance Premiums. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not stock, use or sell any article, or do anything in or about the Premises, which may be prohibited by Landlord\u2019s insurance policies or any endorsements or forms attached thereto, or which will increase any insurance rates and premiums on the Premises, the building of which it is a part and/or any other buildings in the Shopping Center. Tenant shall pay on demand any increase in premiums for Landlord\u2019s insurance, or that of any other tenant in the Shopping Center, resulting from Tenant\u2019s use, occupancy or vacancy of the Premises or the Shopping Center, whether or not Landlord has consented to the same. In determining whether increased premiums are the result of Tenant\u2019s use, occupancy or vacancy of the Premises, a schedule issued by the organization making the fire insurance, extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief, special extended coverage or any all-risk insurance rates for said Premises or any rule books issued by the rating organization or similar bodies or by rating procedures or rules of Landlord\u2019s insurance companies shall be conclusive evidence of the several items and charges which make up the insurance rates and premiums on the Premises and the Shopping Center. If, due to Tenant\u2019s occupancy (or failure to occupy) or abandonment of the Premises, any insurance shall be cancelled by the insurance carrier, or if the premium for any such insurance shall be increased, then, in any of such events, Tenant shall indemnify and hold Landlord harmless and shall pay on demand the increased cost of such insurance. Tenant also shall pay in any of such events any increased premium on the rent insurance that may be carried by Landlord. Section 15.04. Waiver of Subrogation. Landlord and Tenant hereby waive all rights to claims for damages as against the other and the other\u2019s insurance companies, and Landlord\u2019s and Tenant\u2019s insurance policies shall contain provisions requiring that the respective insurance companies waive all rights of subrogation as against Landlord and Tenant and as against the other\u2019s insurance companies, which either party has, or which may arise hereafter, for: damage to the Premises or the Shopping Center; damage to real or personal property located in the Shopping Center; loss of business; any loss for which either party may be reimbursed as a result of insurance coverage affecting any loss suffered by it; or any other loss caused by perils typically covered by fire and extended coverage, building contents, store contents and business interruption insurance coverages. Section 15.05. Insured\u2019s Release. Landlord and Tenant mutually agree that with respect to any loss which is covered by insurance then being carried by them respectively, or required to be carried, the one carrying or required to carry such insurance and suffering said loss hereby releases the other of and from any and all claims with respect to such loss to the extent of such insurance carried or required to be carried. 52 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

Tenant shall give prompt written notice to Landlord, which shall in no event be more than fifteen (15) days after any case of fire or accidents in the Premises, or of any defects therein or in any fixtures or equipment. Promptly following any fire or accident, Tenant shall give written notice to Landlord of any damage claimed. Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement or diminution of Minimum Annual Rent pursuant to Section 17.01 hereof for any period during which it prevents Landlord from repairing that portion of the damages, if any, which it is Landlord\u2019s obligation to repair. ARTICLE 16: LIABILITY OF LANDLORD Section 16.01. Waiver of Liability. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED IN THIS LEASE TO THE CONTRARY, TENANT AGREES THAT IT SHALL LOOK SOLELY TO THE EQUITY INTEREST OF LANDLORD IN THE SHOPPING CENTER (INCLUDING PROFITS AND PROCEEDS OF SAME), SUBJECT TO PRIOR RIGHTS OF ANY MORTGAGEE OR TRUSTEE OF THE SHOPPING CENTER, FOR THE COLLECTION OF ANY JUDGMENT (OR OTHER JUDICIAL PROCESS) REQUIRING THE PAYMENT OF MONEY BY LANDLORD IN THE EVENT OF ANY DEFAULT OR BREACH BY LANDLORD WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE TERMS, COVENANTS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LEASE TO BE OBSERVED AND/OR PERFORMED BY LANDLORD AND NO OTHER ASSETS OF LANDLORD SHALL BE SUBJECT TO LEVY, EXECUTION OR OTHER PROCEDURES FOR THE SATISFACTION OF TENANT\u2019S REMEDIES.

NO SUCH MANAGER, MANAGING MEMBER OR MANAGING AGENT SHALL BE LIABLE OR OBLIGATED TO TENANT UNDER THIS LEASE. Section 16.02. Tenant\u2019s Risk of Loss. Tenant shall store its property in and shall occupy the Premises and all other portions of the Shopping Center at its own risk and releases Landlord, to the full extent permitted by law, from all claims of every kind resulting from loss of life, personal or bodily injury or property damage.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Lease to the contrary, in no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for lost sales or profits or any indirect, consequential or punitive damages. Section 16.03. No Partnership. Landlord neither is nor shall, in any way or for any purpose, become a partner of Tenant in the conduct of its business or otherwise, or joint venturer or a member of a joint enterprise with Tenant. The provisions of this Lease relating to the Percentage Rent payable hereunder, if any, are included solely for the purpose of providing a method whereby Rent is to be measured and ascertained. 53 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

Unless either party\u2019s consent or approval is required by the express terms of this Lease not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed such consent or approval may be withheld or delayed by such party in its sole and arbitrary discretion. If in this Lease it is provided that either party\u2019s consent or approval as to any matter will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and it is established by a Court or other body having final jurisdiction that such party has been unreasonable, the sole effect of such finding shall be that such party shall be deemed to have consented to or approved the matter for which its consent or approval was requested. Neither party shall be liable to the other in any respect for money or money damages by reason of withholding or delaying its consent or approval. Section 16.05. Successors. All rights and liabilities herein given to, or imposed upon, the respective parties hereto shall extend to and bind the respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the said parties. No rights, however, shall inure to the benefit of any assignee of Tenant unless the assignment to such assignee has been approved by Landlord in writing as provided in Article 11 hereof unless Landlord\u2019s approval is not required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Landlord or any successor owner shall convey or otherwise dispose of the Premises, all liabilities and obligations on the part of Landlord or successor owner under this Lease arising or accruing after such conveyance shall cease and terminate and thereupon all such liabilities and obligations shall automatically be binding upon the new owner. ARTICLE 17: DAMAGE CLAUSE Section 17.01. Destruction. If the Premises and/or a material portion of the Shopping Center, including, without limitation, the parking lot is damaged by any event of damage or destruction covered by the insurance policies that Landlord carries or is required to maintain pursuant to this Lease, then such damage shall, except as hereinafter provided, be promptly repaired by Landlord, at Landlord\u2019s expense; provided, however that in no event shall Landlord be required to repair or replace any of Tenant\u2019s property or improvements identified in Sections 15.02(a)(i)(1), (2) and (5), which shall be the obligation of Tenant to replace to at least equal condition immediately prior to such damage. If (i) the Premises are damaged to the extent of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the cost of replacement of the Premises, (ii) the building(s) within the Shopping Center are damaged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of the cost of replacement, notwithstanding the extent of damages to the Premises, (iii) the building containing the Premises is damaged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of the cost of replacement, notwithstanding the extent of damage to the Premises, or (iv) any damage to the Premises occurs during the last Lease Year of the then current Lease Term, then Landlord may elect either to repair or rebuild the Premises or the building(s) within the Shopping Center, as the case may be, or to terminate this Lease upon giving notice of such election in writing to Tenant within ninety (90) days after the event causing the damage, however, Landlord is only permitted to terminate this Lease if it is terminating the leases of all tenants in the building in which the Premises are located and that are similarly affect by the casualty. If the casualty, repairing, or rebuilding shall render the Premises untenantable, in whole or in part, a proportionate abatement of the Rent in proportion to the leasable area of the Premises rendered untenantable shall be allowed until the date that is ninety (90) days after Landlord completes the repairs or rebuilding, provided, if only a portion of the Premises is rendered untenantable but if Tenant determines in its reasonable business judgment that the entire Premises must be closed, and Tenant closes the entire Premises, then all Rent shall abate. 54 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

In the event Landlord elects to repair and restore the Leased Premises, then, within sixty (60) days after the date of the casualty, Landlord shall submit a statement from Landlord\u2019s contractor (the \u201cContractor\u201d) estimating the length of time required to complete the repair and reconstruction of the Leased Premises (\u201cEstimated Repair Period\u201d). In the event the Contractor\u2019s statement reflects that repair and reconstruction of the Leased Premises will require more than three hundred sixty (360) days after the date of such casualty, then for a period of fifteen (15) days after the date of Landlord\u2019s notice, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Landlord. If Tenant fails to terminate this Lease within the aforesaid fifteen (15) day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Lease in accordance with this Section 17.02. In the event the Landlord should fail to complete its repairs on or before the expiration of the Estimated Repair Period (subject to delays caused by Force Majeure), then, at any time following the expiration of the Estimated Repair Period, but in all events prior to the date Landlord completes repairs, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon seven (7) days prior written notice to Landlord. Additionally, in the event that 50% or more of the Premises or a substantial portion of the Center are damaged by fire or other casualty: (i) during the last Lease Year of the then current Lease Term and (ii) such damage was not caused by one or more acts or omissions of Tenant, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Landlord. ARTICLE 18: CONDEMNATION Section 18.01. Condemnation. (a) If the whole of the Premises shall be acquired or condemned by eminent domain for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, then the Lease Term shall cease and terminate as of the date of title vesting in the condemnor in such proceeding and all Rent shall be paid up to that date and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for the value of any unexpired Lease Term. (b) If any part of the Premises or of the Shopping Center shall be acquired or condemned by eminent domain for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, and in the event that such partial taking or condemnation shall render the Premises and/or the Shopping Center unsuitable for the business of Tenant as determined by Landlord, then the Lease Term shall cease and terminate as of the date of title vesting in the condemnor in such proceeding, and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for the value of any unexpired Lease Term, however, Landlord is only permitted to terminate this Lease if it is terminating the leases of all tenants in the Shopping Center similarly affect by the condemnation. In the event of a partial taking or condemnation which is not extensive enough to render the Premises unsuitable for the business of Tenant, then Landlord shall promptly restore the Premises, less the portion lost in the taking, and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. Landlord shall not be required to expend in such restoration more than the proceeds of the award which is reserved for such purpose. The Minimum Annual Rent and the Breakpoint (if the Breakpoint is a fixed amount, that is not determined by dividing the Minimum Annual Rent by the Percentage Rent Rate), if any, shall be reduced in the proportion that the area of the Premises taken bears to the entire area contained in the Premises. (c) In the event of any condemnation or taking as hereinbefore provided, whether whole or partial, Tenant shall not be entitled to any part of the award, as damages or otherwise, for such condemnation and Landlord is to receive the full amount of such award. Tenant hereby expressly waives any right or claim to any part thereof and assigns to Landlord any share of such an award as may be granted to it. 55 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

Under no circumstances shall Tenant\u2019s claim for such award reduce or diminish Landlord\u2019s award nor shall Tenant have a claim for loss of its leasehold estate. ARTICLE 19: PRIORITY OF LEASE Section 19.01. Subordination, Attornment, Power of Attorney. Tenant has been informed and understands that Landlord is now, or may be in the future, a tenant under a lease of the land and/or entire building of which the Premises forms a part. This Lease is and shall be automatically subject and subordinate to all ground or underlying leases and to all mortgages, deeds of trust or liens resulting from any other method of financing or refinancing which now or hereafter affects such leases or the real property of which the Premises forms a part and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof. This Section shall be self-operative and no further instrument of subordination shall be necessary; provided, however, if requested by Landlord\u2019s ground lessor or any mortgagee, Tenant shall execute a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to Tenant and such mortgagee, with commercially reasonable terms, within twenty (20) days after Tenant\u2019s receipt of written request by Landlord. Additionally, in confirmation of such subordination, Tenant shall execute promptly any other certificate or document that Landlord may reasonably request related to this Lease. In the event that any ground or underlying lease is terminated, or any mortgage or deed of trust is foreclosed or title transferred as a result of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, this Lease shall not be terminable by Tenant (and shall not terminate unless Tenant is specifically named in any termination or foreclosure judgment or final order), and Tenant shall attorn to any such successor lessor and recognize such lessor as Landlord under this Lease In the event of a sale or assignment of Landlord\u2019s interest in the building of which the Premises forms a part, Tenant shall attorn to the purchaser and recognize such purchaser as Landlord under this Lease provided such purchaser has assumed, in writing, Landlord\u2019s obligations under this Lease. In the event that any ground or underlying lease is terminated as aforesaid or any mortgage foreclosed or the property transferred by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, Tenant agrees, at Landlord\u2019s, master landlord\u2019s, trustee\u2019s or mortgagee\u2019s option, to enter into a new lease covering the Premises for the remaining Lease Term and otherwise on the same terms, conditions and rentals as herein contained. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, if the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust elects to have this Lease superior to its mortgage or deed of trust, then, upon Tenant being notified to that effect by such encumbrance holder, this Lease shall be deemed prior to the lien of said mortgage or deed of trust, whether this Lease is executed prior to or subsequent to the date of said mortgage or deed of trust. Without limiting the foregoing, upon Tenant\u2019s request, Landlord agrees to request that its current mortgagee provide a subordination and non-disturbance agreement in favor of Tenant on such mortgagee\u2019s current form; provided, however, non-receipt of the subordination and non-disturbance agreement shall not constitute a breach or default by Landlord under this Lease nor shall the effectiveness of this Lease be conditioned upon receipt of the same. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as Additional Rent, any and all fees or charges imposed by such mortgagee in connection 56 #13741219v1\\018998\\0187"

If such lender will not agree to receive or review such request without prior payment of fees or charges (such as a retainer), Landlord reserves the right to condition any effort to obtain the subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement on Tenant\u2019s delivery to Landlord of the requisite sums. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Lease, and Tenant\u2019s right of possession of the Premises, shall not be subordinate to any future ground or underlying lease or mortgage, unless and until Tenant receives a fully executed subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement, in commercially reasonable form from the overlessor or mortgagee, as the case may be. Section 19.02. Estoppel. Each party hereto shall, from time to time, but not more than once in any 12 month period, (unless Landlord\u2019s request for an estoppel is as a result of a potential sale or financing of the Shopping Center, in which event no such limitation shall apply) as requested by the other party, execute and deliver to the requesting party (or to a party designated), within twenty (20) days of written demand therefor, a written statement which shall: (i) certify that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, setting forth all modifications and certifying that the same is in full force and effect as so modified); (ii) confirm that there is no default under this Lease (or specifying any default); (iii) set forth the Minimum Annual Rent and Additional Rent currently due under the Lease and state the date to which Minimum Annual Rent and Additional Rent have been paid or received; (iv) confirm whether there are any subleases affecting the Premises; and (v) contain such other information or confirmations as may reasonably be required. The failure by either party to comply with its obligation in this Section 19.02 shall be a default hereunder if such failure is not cured within seven (7) business days after the defaulting party receives notice of the default.

After receipt of complete Plans, Landlord shall either approve or disapprove the Plans within ten (10) business days, stating with specificity the reasons for disapproval. Landlord\u2019s approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided, however, that Landlord\u2019s approval of portions of Tenant\u2019s Work impacting the Premises\u2019 exterior, base building systems (such as electrical, mechanical, and life safety systems), and structural elements of the Premises, shall be within Landlord\u2019s sole discretion. Within ten (10) business days after receipt of Landlord\u2019s disapproval of the Plans, Tenant shall revise and resubmit the Plans to Landlord. The foregoing procedure shall be repeated until Landlord has approved the Plans (as approved, the \u201cFinal Plans\u201d). Any changes to the Final Plans requested by Tenant shall be subject to Landlord\u2019s approval and any costs incurred by Landlord to review such requested changes shall be reimbursed by Tenant upon Landlord\u2019s written demand. In the event Landlord fails to timely respond to Tenant\u2019s plans and specifications within twenty (20) days after Landlord\u2019s receipt of such plans, then if such failure continues for more than five (5) business days after Tenant\u2019s subsequent delivery of a \u201cDeadline Letter\u201d (as hereinafter defined), Tenant\u2019s plans submitted to Landlord shall be deemed approved. For purposes hereof, the term \u201cDeadline Letter\u201d shall be defined as a letter which states in bold letters the following: \u201cLandlord is obligated to respond to the attached plans and specifications within five (5) business days after receipt.

Tenant also acknowledges that Landlord has no liability to Tenant or any other person or entity as a result of Landlord\u2019s approval of said Plans for any defects, omissions, inconsistencies or shortcomings contained in such Plans or the work to be performed in accordance therewith. 2. Permits. Tenant shall apply for, and diligently seek, all permits and licenses necessary for the performance of Tenant\u2019s Work (\u201cPermits\u201d) within seven (7) days after the date Tenant receives Landlord\u2019s approval of Tenant\u2019s Plans (the \u201cPermit Application Submission Deadline\u201d). Tenant shall use best efforts to secure the Permits promptly, including the use of an expediter. If Landlord\u2019s signature is required by the authority having jurisdiction for any application for any Permit, or for the issuance of any Permit, Landlord shall not assume or be deemed to assume any liabilities, obligations or costs as a result thereof, all of which shall remain Tenant\u2019s responsibility. If Tenant misses either the Plans Submission Deadline or Permit Application Submission Deadline, then Landlord shall deliver a notice to Tenant stating that Tenant has missed the Plans Submission Deadline or Permit Application Submission Deadline, as applicable (each, a \u201cMissed Deadline Notice\u201d). Tenant shall have 5 business days after the date of its receipt of a Missed Deadline Notice (\u201cMissed Deadline Cure Period\u201d) to submit its Plans to Landlord in accordance with this Lease or file its Permit application in accordance with this Lease, as the case may be.
